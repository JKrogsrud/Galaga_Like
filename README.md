## Galaga Like using pygame

### Contributions

I primarily worked on the backend and logic behind the game itself with the aid of pygame tutorials.
You can see my contributions in battle_line.py, bullet.py, enemy.py, weapon.py, and game logic in main.py.

### Project Description

This project was a group collaboration with a focus on learning how to work well on a team, with individuals working on different aspects of the game. Ultimately the goal was to create a game similar to the arcade game Galaga, creating one to three levels of increasing difficulty.
